## Features

- **Fishing**: The script finds the nearest fishing spot and baits it when your player is idle and has enough inventory space.
- **Inventory Management**: If your inventory is full, the script automatically drops leaping trout, leaping salmon, and leaping sturgeon to make space.
- **Special Attacks**: If your combat special attack is ready (100/100), the script will use it.
- **Running**: The script checks your running energy and turns running on when it reaches 10000.
